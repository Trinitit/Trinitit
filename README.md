![Hi, I'm Eric](https://github.com/Trinitit/Trinitit/blob/main/greeting.gif)

## ðŸŒ± I'm trying to learn how the digital world works around me.
### On this journey I fight my way through the virtual jungle and find interesting topics with which piece by piece an understandable overall picture arises.

#### :point_right: In my spare time I work on rather small projects that are not yet ready to be published. 
#### :construction_worker: Professionally, I am currently a software tester.
